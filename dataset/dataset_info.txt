This project is using Final Release (3.0) of the Face-Place Face Database.
Dataset has been filtered to obtain smooth images with clean samples of races, mostly without glasses and with clear face view.
Dataset usage rules are included in this folder as README3_0.pdf
Dataset can be obtained from http://wiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/Face_Place, however, has to be converted to bmp to avoid opencv python bug.
Screenshot of files included to make clear organization used in source program.
